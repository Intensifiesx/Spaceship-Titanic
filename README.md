# Cosmic Mystery Machine Learning Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Cosmic Mystery Machine Learning Project! This project focuses on predicting which passengers of the Spaceship Titanic were transported to an alternate dimension after colliding with a spacetime anomaly. The objective is to analyze data recovered from the spaceship's damaged computer system to assist in rescuing the affected passengers. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview

## Dataset

The dataset consists of two main files:

-   `train.csv`: Contains the training data with passenger records and the anomaly transport status.
-   `test.csv`: Includes test data with passenger records; your model should predict the anomaly transport status for these passengers.

## Model Development

I have developed a machine learning model to predict the anomaly transport status of passengers. The model is based on a HistGradientBoostingClassifier from the scikit-learn library. The model achieved an accuracy of Score: 0.79541 and earned position #1157 on the leaderboard.
